## Parts Explanation
| Part Name  | Explanation |Image |Datasheet |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------|  -------------|
| KP Original Battery SM4PIN 7.4V 14500 1000 mAh Rechargeable Lithium ion Battery  | We use two separate batteries: one dedicated to power the motors (to ensure high current demands are met) and the other for logic and sensors to provide stable voltage and extend runtime. This dual-battery approach ensures uninterrupted operation and maximal performance throughout each run. | ![image ](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kfdiVbTWhyWyHCSF2aAfYXwkoSjrG1Fu) |
| LM2596 DC-DC Adjustable Buck Converter Step Down Module 1.23-30V  | Efficient step-down regulator that voltage-transforms from 7.4 V to stable 5 V/3.3 V for Arduino and sensors with minimal heat loss. It delivers up to 3 A with high efficiency (~92%) and built-in protection features (thermal shutdown, current limit) |![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1IY64IZBimiTXVq3Kx2tvubgiA2Bl6Qe3) |
| L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver| Drives two DC motors with independent direction and speed (via PWM). Supports up to 2 A per motor, ideal for differential drive. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tXrZfk9EezPFPw6wGRVEAbeEguXa9JIU) |
| GP2Y0A41SK0F IR Range Sensor | Side-facing angled IR sensor used during navigation and parking to measure proximity to track walls. Allows real-time wall detection and precise maneuvers. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xwOx8zZHTQgf1Wjt1V4txaGHvYAQ8lT-) |
| GP2Y0A02YK0F IR Range Sensor| 	Front and rear long-range IR sensors for obstacle detection and wall following on the track; provides early warning of oncoming objects. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1F55yUT20tSSz39H0R63rNhZXxBJJ9XJZ) |
| CJMCU34725 TCS34725 RGB Light Color Sensor| Positioned under the chassis to detect colored track markers (blue/orange laps, parking zone). Enables color-triggered lane decisions and lap counting. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1D3hcOZrf5F4I4LHi9Mp_u0nN94aHiGuu) |
| DC 6V Electric Motors 29RPM 6mm Shaft High Torque Gear Box Speed Reduction Fan Motors Electric Motor| Provides robust propulsion with gear reduction. The motor runs on its own high-current battery for maximum speed and torque. Ideal for reliable track performance. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ybWaDzC_cinArdB4cHRGsbbjlKYPTn5r) |
| Microservo Gsmin TowerPro SG90 (BT907570) | Controls steering linkage. Offers ~1.8 kg·cm stall torque, fast response (~0.1 s/60°), and stable operation at 4.8–6 V . | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12YB7SkZg-SKjs5M_Nsm6QyPDyY2nTXtF) |
| MPU6050 - 3 axis gyroscope and 3 axis acclerometer| Detects yaw and orientation for precise turning and straight-line stability. Gyro integration aids in accurate parking and obstacle avoidance. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AmbqXg5adtF_ad26dOOWkO59S26QTGBE) |
| Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 Distance Measurement Sensor Sensor for Arduino| Mounted sideways to assist with parallel parking. Offers reliable short-range measurements to walls/fence during alignment. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1oVq5CuIJBpn_x2iV9vw5AWjzw2FTgU8f) |
| Arduino Uno | The Arduino Uno is the brain of the robot, responsible for processing all sensor inputs and controlling the actuators (motors, servos, and cameras). It is an easy-to-use development board that supports various libraries and can interface with many sensors and actuators, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and competition environments. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ueKYDqAqAWMduv0KdD1EX3oH6jArNXLT) |
| HuskyLens AI Camera | 	The HuskyLens AI Camera is used for object detection, line following, and color recognition. It uses artificial intelligence to process visual data in real time, allowing the robot to make decisions based on the environment, such as following a line or detecting obstacles. This camera offloads much of the vision processing, making it suitable for real-time applications. It is especially effective for line tracking and obstacle avoidance when paired with a microcontroller like Arduino. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_YQLQX0rSTZfo8hzB6r0pkvx1vcfkECd) |
